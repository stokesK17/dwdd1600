        <h2>Artists</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Radiohead</h3>
                Radiohead's impact on the indie and alternative genres is immeasurable. From their early albums like
                Pablo
                Honey to their genre-defying Kid A and beyond, they've always pushed the boundaries of what music can
                be.
                Their blend of rock, electronic, experimental, and even jazz influences has influenced countless artists
                across all genres, making them one of the most celebrated and innovative bands of all time.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>The Velvet Underground</h3>
                The Velvet Underground, led by Lou Reed, is often considered the foundation of alternative rock. Their
                experimental sound, blending rock with avant-garde, noise, and art influences, set them apart from
                mainstream music in the '60s. Their debut album, The Velvet Underground & Nico, became a blueprint for
                future alternative, indie, and underground music movements. Their raw, confessional lyrics on topics
                like
                addiction, sexuality, and alienation resonated deeply and inspired generations of musicians.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Pixies</h3>
                The Pixies are often credited with shaping the alternative rock sound of the '80s and '90s. Their
                dynamic
                mix of quiet-loud song structures, surf-rock, punk, and surrealist lyrics influenced bands like Nirvana,
                Radiohead, and countless others. Albums like Surfer Rosa and Doolittle are considered essential indie
                records. The Pixies created a sound that was uniquely their own while influencing a wave of indie rock
                bands
                that followed.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>David Bowie</h3>
                While often more associated with glam rock and art pop, David Bowie’s impact on alternative music is
                undeniable. He blurred genres throughout his career, often straddling the lines between mainstream and
                avant-garde music. His albums Low, Heroes, and The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust are essential
                listening
                for anyone interested in alternative and indie music. His constant reinvention and ability to push
                musical
                boundaries made him an icon for alternative artists.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>The Smiths</h3>
                The Smiths, led by Morrissey and Johnny Marr, created one of the most distinctive sounds in alternative
                music with their jangly guitars, melancholic lyrics, and unique vocal delivery. Their influence on indie
                rock cannot be overstated—albums like The Queen Is Dead and Strangeways, Here We Come are timeless, with
                their blend of post-punk, indie, and alternative styles helping shape the sound of the '80s and '90s.
                Morrissey’s witty and poetic lyrics continue to resonate with fans of alternative music. <br>
                These artists helped define and elevate the alternative and indie scenes, breaking boundaries and
                pushing
                musical and cultural norms. Their legacies continue to influence generations of musicians today.
