            <li>
                <h3>Miles Davis</h3>
                Miles Davis is one of the most influential jazz musicians of all time, known for his constant
                reinvention of the genre. From the bebop era to modal jazz and fusion, Davisâ€™ career spanned several
                decades and marked major turning points in jazz history. His work on albums like Kind of Blue and
                Bitches Brew showcases his unparalleled creativity and vision within the genre.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>John Coltrane</h3>
                John Coltraneâ€™s impact on jazz is immeasurable, as his virtuosity on the saxophone and his
                groundbreaking approaches to improvisation changed the landscape of jazz. His albums, such as A Love
                Supreme and Giant Steps, are considered among the greatest in jazz history, and his spiritual and
                technical evolution continues to influence musicians across genres.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Duke Ellington</h3>
                Duke Ellington was a composer, bandleader, and pianist whose influence on jazz is profound. As one of
                the most important figures in the development of big band jazz, his compositions like Mood Indigo and
                Take the A Train became timeless standards. Ellingtonâ€™s ability to blend complex harmonies and
                inventive orchestrations redefined what jazz could be.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Bill Evans</h3>
                Bill Evans is considered one of the most important jazz pianists, known for his lyrical playing and
                innovative approach to harmony. His work on Kind of Blue with Miles Davis is legendary, but his solo
                albums, such as Sunday at the Village Vanguard, are also considered essential listening. Evansâ€™
                introspective style and his contributions to the development of modal jazz left a lasting legacy.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Charlie Parker</h3>
                Charlie Parker, also known as "Bird," was one of the pioneers of bebop, a fast-paced, complex form of
                jazz that emphasized improvisation. His virtuosic alto saxophone playing and innovative compositions,
                such as Ko-Ko and Ornithology, helped shape the sound of modern jazz. Parkerâ€™s contributions to jazz
                continue to influence musicians to this day.
