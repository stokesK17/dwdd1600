        <p>Rooted in orchestral compositions from the Renaissance to modern film scores, featuring composers like
            Beethoven, Mozart, and Debussy.</p>
        <h2>Albums</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Symphony No. 9 in D Minor ‚Äì <em>Ludwig van Beethoven</em></h3>
                Genre: Classical, Orchestral<br>
                Standout Tracks: <em>Ode to Joy, Allegro ma non troppo</em><br>
                Beethoven‚Äôs Symphony No. 9 is one of the most iconic pieces of classical music ever composed. Known
                for its grand scale and the inclusion of vocal soloists and a choir in the final movement ("Ode to
                Joy"), this symphony represents a pinnacle of the Romantic period. Its profound themes of unity and
                human spirit have resonated for generations and continue to inspire listeners.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Eine kleine Nachtmusik ‚Äì <em>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</em></h3>
                Genre: Classical, Chamber Music<br>
                Standout Tracks: <em>Allegro, Romance, Rondo</em><br>
                Mozart‚Äôs Eine kleine Nachtmusik (A Little Night Music) is a quintessential example of Classical-era
                chamber music. Its lively, elegant melodies and refined structure have made it one of Mozart‚Äôs most
                beloved works. The piece's upbeat character and melodic simplicity make it both accessible and
                emotionally resonant, representing the classical period at its most elegant.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Clair de Lune ‚Äì <em>Claude Debussy</em></h3>
                Genre: Impressionism, Piano Music<br>
                Standout Tracks: <em>Clair de Lune, Arabesque No. 1, Reverie</em><br>
                Debussy‚Äôs Clair de Lune is one of the most well-known piano pieces in the classical repertoire. Its
                dreamy, impressionistic style evokes the subtle beauty of moonlight, with gentle shifts in harmony and
                color that reflect the fluidity of the natural world. Debussy‚Äôs innovative approach to sound,
                particularly in works like Clair de Lune, marked a shift toward the Impressionist movement in music.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>The Four Seasons ‚Äì <em>Antonio Vivaldi</em></h3>
                Genre: Baroque, Violin Concerto<br>
                Standout Tracks: <em>Spring, Summer, Autumn, Winter</em><br>
                The Four Seasons by Antonio Vivaldi is a set of violin concertos that are some of the most
                recognizable and widely performed works in classical music. Each concerto is intended to represent a
                different season, with vibrant and expressive melodies evoking the moods and scenes of nature. The
                lively ‚ÄúSpring‚Äù and dramatic ‚ÄúWinter‚Äù are just two examples of how Vivaldi‚Äôs music perfectly captures
                the essence of each season.
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Requiem in D Minor ‚Äì <em>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</em></h3>
                Genre: Classical, Choral Music<br>
                Standout Tracks: <em>Requiem aeternam, Lacrimosa</em><br>
                Mozart‚Äôs Requiem in D Minor is one of the most moving and powerful works in the choral repertoire.
                Written near the end of his life, the piece is filled with dramatic contrasts, emotional depth, and
                profound beauty. The Lacrimosa movement is particularly famous for its hauntingly beautiful melodies,
                capturing a sense of grief and solemnity that speaks across centuries.

        <h2>Composers</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Ludwig van Beethoven</h3>
                Beethoven is one of the most influential composers in the history of Western music. His works, such as
                Symphony No. 5, Symphony No. 9, and Moonlight Sonata, span the transition from the Classical to
                the Romantic era. His compositions, often marked by dramatic intensity and innovation, have had a
                lasting impact on the development of symphonic and instrumental music.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart</h3>
                Mozart is renowned for his prolific output and mastery of nearly every genre of music, from symphonies
                to operas to chamber music. Works like The Magic Flute, Eine kleine Nachtmusik, and Requiem
                showcase his unmatched ability to blend technical precision with deep emotional expressiveness. Mozart‚Äôs
                work remains central to the classical music canon.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Claude Debussy</h3>
                Debussy is one of the leading figures of the Impressionist movement in music. His works, such as Clair
                de Lune, Pr√©lude √† l'apr√®s-midi d'un faune, and La Mer, are celebrated for their atmospheric,
                textural qualities and innovative use of harmony. Debussy‚Äôs music often evokes imagery and emotion
                rather than following traditional forms, making him a pivotal figure in the transition to modern music.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Johann Sebastian Bach</h3>
                Bach is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers of the Baroque era, known for his deeply
                intricate counterpoint and expressive works. His compositions, such as Brandenburg Concerto No. 3,
                Toccata and Fugue in D Minor, and Mass in B Minor, remain cornerstones of the classical music
                repertoire and continue to influence musicians across genres.
            </li>

            <li>
                <h3>Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky</h3>
                Tchaikovsky is one of the most beloved composers of the Romantic period, known for his emotionally
                charged and richly orchestrated works. His ballet scores, such as Swan Lake, The Nutcracker, and
                Sleeping Beauty, have become iconic. Tchaikovsky‚Äôs Symphony No. 6 (‚ÄúPath√©tique‚Äù) is one of his most
                famous symphonies, filled with profound emotional depth and intense melodic beauty.
